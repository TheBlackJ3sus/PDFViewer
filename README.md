Very basic SwiftUI UIViewController wrapper for both PDFView and PDFThumbnailView
Create with PDFDocument or an array of UIImages and basic options. 

To Do:
1. Default PDFThumbnailView is ugly, drag animations would be cool I guess
2. Idk how PDFThumbnailView works, the documentation is basic? May have to create a custom PDFThumbnailView... somehow idk.
